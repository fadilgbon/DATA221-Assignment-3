# DATA221-Assignment-3
"""
Question 1:
The program loads the crime dataset, extracts the ViolentCrimesPerPop column, calculates its key statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum), prints them, and then you interpret what those values say about the distribution.

Question 2 :
The program creates a histogram and a boxplot of ViolentCrimesPerPop, displays both graphs with proper labels, and then you describe what the plots reveal about the spread, skewness, median, and presence of outliers.

Question 3 :
The program loads the kidney disease dataset, separates the features and labels, splits them into training and testing sets, and then you explain why training and testing must be done on different data.

Question 4:
The program trains a KNN model with k=5 on the training data, predicts the test labels, computes evaluation metrics (confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score), prints them, and then you explain what these metrics mean and why accuracy alone is not enough.

Question 5:
The program trains multiple KNN models using different k values, calculates and stores the test accuracy for each, prints a table of results, identifies the best k, and then you explain how changing k affects overfitting and underfitting.
